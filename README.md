# PyDrive

__This project is currently unfinished and unmaintained. Maybe someday I will have time to finish it.__


This a simple command line client for Google Drive written in python. 
Currently it allows you to search file and download them. 
You will also need a working web browser.

You will need an api key for the Google Drive REST api. Simply replace the place holder in the client\_seceret file.
